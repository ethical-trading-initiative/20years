<p>Following the Morecambe Bay tragedy, we campaign for better legal protection for vulnerable workers in the UK. We lead a cross-industry alliance to lobby the government to introduce extra legal protection for up to 600,000 workers in the UK food industry. This campaign results in the Gangmaster (Licensing) Act 2006.</p>

<p>Our work globally to protect vulnerable workers continues. We have, for example, recently published a <a href="https://www.ethicaltrade.org/resources/addressing-worker-vulnerability-in-agricultural-and-food-supply-chains-vulnerable-workers">Vulnerable Workers Toolkit</a> as well as <a href="https://www.ethicaltrade.org/resources/human-rights-due-diligence-framework">Due Diligence Guidance</a> and advised companies on the <a href="https://www.ethicaltrade.org/resources/north-korea-state-sponsored-forced-labour-briefing-note">export of state sponsored forced labour from North Korea</a>.</p>
