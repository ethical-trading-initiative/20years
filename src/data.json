      "intro": "<p>In January 1998, a small number of British retailers join aid agencies and trade unionists to discuss the promotion of fundamental human rights in global supply chains. Subsequently, under the pivotal leadership of Secretary of State for International Development Claire Short, ETI is incorporated as a not-for-profit company on 9th June. We receive start-up grants from the Department for International Development and the Department of Trade and Industry…</p>",

The Ethical Trading Initiative is an important first step and will provide a common approach to enable change.<cite>Dino Adriano, Chief Executive, J Sainsburys PLC</cite></blockquote><p>From the very start, we agree that corporate, NGO and trade union members must work together collaboratively to identify and promote good practice. Our tripartite approach is born.</p><p>Our first task is to negotiate and draw up a model code of conduct – a Base Code which reflects internationally agreed labour standards – and to approve a set of implementation principles that will lead to best practice in applying the Code.</p><p>Today, the Base Code remains almost identical to what it was in 1998. So too is the expectation on members: to work towards the continuous improvement of their ethical trade policies and practices and to report annually against these.</p><p>More broadly, the Base Code is still viewed as a gold standard and many thousands of companies work towards it, whether members or not.</p><ul><li>Our five pioneering company members are ASDA, Premier Brands, The Body Shop, Littlewoods and Sainsbury's. By the end of the year they are joined by seven others.</li><li>Oxfam, Christian Aid, Fairtrade Foundation and the World Development Movement are the first NGO members, with the TUC representing trade unions.</li></ul>",
