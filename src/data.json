      "intro": "Retail members become increasingly concerned about the treatment of homeworkers in their supply chains. They realise that homeworkers carry out essential tasks such as embroidery, stitching, assembly and packaging, but that retail oversight is either limited or non-existent.

      "intro": "NGO members investigate wages paid to homeworkers making Christmas crackers in South Wales and discover shockingly low rates of pay – in some cases as little as £1.50 an hour. They find that a government regulation known as the ‘four fifths rule', and originally intended to protect slower-piece rate workers, has the effect of allowing employers to pay only 80 per cent of the national minimum wage. We ask retail members of our Homeworkers Working Group to support an advocacy campaign to amend the law…"
